## Node-Mocha Test Runner

This tool provides a convenient way to test code for student-assessment purposes.

### Usage

Specify the test number using `npm`:

```terminal
npm run test 1
```

The above command would execute `test_01.js`.

### Directory Structure

The test spec files can be found in the `tests/` directory, and the corresponding code submission for testing is in the directory `lib/`.

The `lib/` files should export any functions or objects required for testing.
